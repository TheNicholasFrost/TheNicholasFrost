- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheNicholasFrost you may be able to guess my real name. If it's good enough to publish, I may as well put my name behind it.
- 👀 I’m interested in same thing as ever, knocking down the ivory towers created by technological eltitism. I was bringing this up as early as the days when I was an authorized dealer for Autodesk, selling every copy of AutoCAD and 3D Studio Max fom Sacramento to Eugene.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dart via flutter and flutter via flutterflow- and building many custom widgets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my current project, Thicket. It's a leftist and queer social media app that harkens to the web 1.0 days of the internet. I'm working alone with AI tools and images, but that's because I am lacking flesh and blood collaborators. If you strongly object, and would rather improve than destroy, add your skills, (not for free, but I still cannot pay much) and I'll replace AI grnerated work with human work. It's going to be a Frankenstein's creature when it's done, but please don't come at it with the torches. I know I'm not good coder. There are likely some basic principles of coding the original codebase violates. That's reason #2 this is open source (#1 is trust). I invite you to become a member of the community, and if you have skill and you care, make it better. Improve the code. This can ever only work if it can evolve. Be a part of the evolution.
- 📫 How to reach me nicholas@thicketapp.com (This... may not be active yet, the website is a b list priority. There will be one, but once I have more of the body of work done.)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm using the app to help groups organize.
